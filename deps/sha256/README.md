# SHA256

A C++ SHA256 implementation.

## Build

**Minimum C++11.**

Just run `make all`. There are no dependencies.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

This library has been developed for research and learning purposes. It **has not been audited** for security nor compliance with the standard. It is not advised to use it in projects where security is important. Use wide-spread and reliable libraries such as [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) instead.

## Example usage

### Sample program

Provide as many strings as you want. The program will hash all of them in order.

```
$ ./SHA256 "string" "string2"

```

### As a library

```cpp
#include "SHA256.h"

//...

string s = "hello world";
SHA256 sha;
sha.update(s);
std::array<uint8_t, 32> digest = sha.digest();

std::cout << SHA256::toString(digest) << std::endl;
```

## Using tipi.build to install SHA256

`SHA256` can be easily used with the [tipi.build](https://tipi.build) dependency manager, by adding the following to a `.tipi/deps`:

```json
{
    "System-Glitch/SHA256": { }
}
```

An example to try is available in `https://github.com/tipi-deps/example-System-Glitch-SHA256` (change the target name appropriately to `linux` or `macos` or `windows`):

```bash
tipi . -t <target>
```

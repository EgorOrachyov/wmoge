**"Write my own game engine (wmoge)"** is a modern high-performance 2d and 3d graphics game engine with Vulkan and
OpenGL backends. The idea of the project is to implement a self-sufficient, small, but featured engine and a number of
2d and 3d games using it. Primary focus is the core architecture of the engine, reliability, clean and performant code.
Currently, the work is focused on a minor refactoring, new runtime scene representation, building a high-level rendering
system, refactoring audio, scripting systems, and bringing physics support. The engine is a personal learning/hobby
project for educational purposes only.

Current progress can be tracked at GitHub [tasks page](https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/wmoge/issues).

## Building from sources

### Prerequisites

- **Common**:
    - Git (to get source code)
    - CMake (the latest version)
    - Ninja (as build files generator)
    - Python 3.7+
- **Windows 10**:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler (MSVC) with C++ 17 support
    - x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS
- **Ubuntu 20.04**:
    - GNU C++ Compiler with C++ 17 support
- **Ma—ÅOS Catalina 10.15**:
    - Clang Compiler with C++ 17 support

### Get source code

The following code snippet downloads project source code repository, and enters project root folder. Must be executed
from the folder where you want to locate project.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/EgorOrachyov/wmoge.git
$ cd wmoge
```

### Configure and run build

> **Attention!** On Windows platform building commands must be executed in `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS`.

The following code snippet runs `build.py` script, which allows configuring cmake and running of actual build with
selected options. You can specify build directory, build type, number of system threads for build.
Must be executed from project root folder.

```shell
$ python ./build.py --build-dir=build --build-type=Release --nt=4
```

On macOS, you can optionally specify target binaries architecture to build. Pass option `--arch`
with `x86_64` or `arm64` respectively. By default, build falls back to `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` specified architecture.
See example bellow, replace `<arch>` with desired architecture for your build. Must be executed from project root
folder.

```shell
$ python ./build.py --build-dir=build --build-type=Release --nt=4 --arch=<arch>
```

In order to run a template project demo, you need to manually copy `template` folder content into the
`build/template` directory and run template.exe. The template project will start up and enter main loop. Alternatively,
the executable can be stated from the IDE by running `template/main.cpp` entry point.

## Contributing

If you want to fix code or tutorial text issue, add new functionality, or even new tutorial step, feel free to
contribute to the project following [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning project. It does not claim to be the ultimate guide to building real AAA game engines.
However, it can be useful for those who, like me at the time, want to learn something more than the basics and do
something on their own. This project accumulates ideas and knowledge from several books and can be a good starting point
for learning!

## Also

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at `egororachyov@gmail.com`. If you have any ideas, questions, how to
make or improve something, please, do not hesitate to open new issue or pull-request inside this project. I will try to
respond as soon as possible to them.
